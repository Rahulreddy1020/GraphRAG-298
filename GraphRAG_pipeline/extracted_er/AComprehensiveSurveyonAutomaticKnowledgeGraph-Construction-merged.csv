7,"Many contributions have been made to formally define knowledge graphs. Wang et al. modeled a knowledge graph as a multi-relation graph, where the nodes are entities and the edges represent different types of relationships. Ehrlinger and Wo√ü further emphasize that a knowledge graph arranges information into an ontology and then enlightens novel knowledge discovery with a reasoner. Wu et al. define a knowledge graph as a semantic graph where the nodes represent concepts (entities/attributes/facts), and the edges represent relationships that connect the nodes while drawing on background knowledge about the concepts and relations.","[{'entity1': 'Knowledge Graph', 'relationship': 'modeled as', 'entity2': 'multi-relation graph'}, {'entity1': 'Knowledge Graph', 'relationship': 'arranges', 'entity2': 'information'}, {'entity1': 'Knowledge Graph', 'relationship': 'enlightens', 'entity2': 'knowledge discovery'}, {'entity1': 'Knowledge Graph', 'relationship': 'represents', 'entity2': 'semantic graph'}, {'entity1': 'nodes', 'relationship': 'represent', 'entity2': 'concepts'}, {'entity1': 'edges', 'relationship': 'connect', 'entity2': 'nodes'}]"

9,"The Max Planck Institution developed YAGO, which integrates temporal and geographical structures in Wikipedia with a WordNet ontology.

10,"Linguistic knowledge graphs deliver knowledge of the human language to provide basic semantics as ontologies or external features. WordNet is a classical widely-used knowledge graph dictionary for linguistic study, providing synonymy or hyponymy relationships among words. With these tools, developers create high-performance word embeddings based on well-built linguistic knowledge graphs for downstream applications. Beyond WordNet, BabelNet extends WordNet with cross-lingual attributes and relations of words from encyclopedias.","[{'entity1': 'Linguistic knowledge graphs', 'relationship': 'deliver', 'entity2': 'knowledge'}, {'entity1': 'WordNet', 'relationship': 'provides', 'entity2': 'synonymy'}, {'entity1': 'WordNet', 'relationship': 'provides', 'entity2': 'hyponymy'}, {'entity1': 'developers', 'relationship': 'create', 'entity2': 'word embeddings'}, {'entity1': 'BabelNet', 'relationship': 'extends', 'entity2': 'WordNet'}]"
11,"Knowledge graphs and their related systems have been effectively supporting the business of enterprise activities. Google Knowledge Graph (GKG), served as a core function since 2012, delivers knowledge support for user queries and enriches the results with more semantically-related content.

12,"Commonsense knowledge graphs depict widely-accepted knowledge of common understandings. OpenCyc is one of the earliest of these attempts, which encodes knowledge concepts, rules, and common sense ideas in the form of CycL.

14,"Knowledge acquisition is the general process of collecting elements from multi-structured data to build a knowledge graph.

15,"Entity discovery acquires a subset of concepts from semi-structured or structured data that can constitute the nodes of a knowledge graph. The general procedure of entity discovery includes named entity recognition, entity typing, and entity linking tasks. Named entity recognition tasks discover strings that refer to semantic entities and then classify them to the general types (e.g., person, location, country, company). Entity typing tasks categorize the found entities into specific types (e.g., actor, artist, brand). Entity linking associates a discovered entity with a possible node in the knowledge graph.","[{'entity1': 'Entity discovery', 'relationship': 'acquires', 'entity2': 'subset of concepts'}, {'entity1': 'Entity discovery', 'relationship': 'constitute', 'entity2': 'nodes of a knowledge graph'}, {'entity1': 'Named entity recognition', 'relationship': 'discover', 'entity2': 'strings'}, {'entity1': 'Named entity recognition', 'relationship': 'classify', 'entity2': 'general types'}, {'entity1': 'Entity typing', 'relationship': 'categorize', 'entity2': 'found entities'}, {'entity1': 'Entity linking', 'relationship': 'associates', 'entity2': 'discovered entity'}]"
