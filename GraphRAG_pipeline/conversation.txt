user: what is acute inflammation?
bot: Acute inflammation is the initial response of the body to
harmful stimuli and is characterized by the rapid
recruitment of immune cells to the site of injury or
infection.

user: what is difference between acute and chronic
bot: Acute inflammation is a short-term, immediate response to an
injury or infection, while chronic inflammation is a
prolonged, persistent response that can be protective or
pathogenic depending on the circumstances.

user: tell me about acute inflammation
bot: Inflammation can be beneficial as a self-limiting, healing
process, but persistent inflammation can have both
protective and pathogenic effects. Chronic inflammation can
affect hematopoiesis and B lymphopoiesis by diverting
lymphoid progenitors from the B lineage, inducing apoptosis
in developing B cells, and mobilizing developing B cells to
the periphery. Additionally, inflammation can alter
hematopoietic output by favoring myelopoiesis over
lymphopoiesis.

user: tell me about inflammation
bot: Inflammation can be beneficial or pathogenic depending on
the circumstances, and it is associated with
atherosclerosis. Inflammation induces extramedullary B
lymphopoiesis.

Atherosclerosis (including that in CAD) has been reported to be associated not only with local inflammation in the arterial walls but also with the systemic inflammatory response (32, 33).

Although the hypothesis that hyperlipidemia is central to the process of atherosclerosis has been vali- dated by numerous data, great attention was also di- rected to the new hypothesis that atherosclerosis might be a specific form of the chronic inflammatory process. Statins might reduce coronary risk by their multiple pleio- tropic effects in addition to their lipid-lowering effects. Further studies are therefore necessary to clarify the roles of infection, cytokines, immunity and inflammation re- garding hyperlipidemia during the development of ath- erosclerosis\n\nAcknowledgments: The author wishes to acknowledge the essential contributions of Drs.

Especially, the relationships among pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-18 and osteopontin, and anti- inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 receptor antagonist, IL-10 and IL-18 binding pro- tein to inflammation and atherosclerosis were investigated and are described in de- tail. In addition, helicobacter pylori and C pneumoniae infections to inflammations regarding the persistence of inflammation have been pointed out. A pro-inflammatory genotype or haplotype and toll-like receptors have been shown to be involved in hu- man atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis might therefore be a specific form of the chronic inflammatory process. In addition to hyperlipidemia, infections, cytokines and immu- nity might also be involved in the development of atherosclerosis. Certain treatments that reduce coronary risk also limit inflammation. Statins possess multiple pleiotropic effects such as an anti-inflammatory effect in addition to a lipid-lowering effect.

Generally, inflammation is regarded as a beneficial, self-limiting, healing process, allowing for the clearance of the initiating stimuli via localized recruitment of immune effector cells. However, when the inflammatory stimulus persists, the resulting chronic inflammation can be protective or pathogenic depending on the circumstances. For example, granulomas can wall off persistent inflammatory agents when the normal mechanisms of antigen clearance fail or are otherwise insufficient (Chattopadhyay, 1994).\nWe and many others have used pristane (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane), a natural, saturated 19-C alkane, to induce chronic peritoneal inflammation (Potter, 2003; Richards et al., 1999). When injected into the peritoneal cavity, pristane is either phagocytosed by\n \nCain et al.\tPage 9'], 1.3898038864135742)
